# Comment on "Limited scope for latitudinal extension of reef corals"

The data, analysis and figure for our comment on Muir et al. (2015) Science. The comment was rejected based on Muir et al.'s response to it, and so we have posted it as a pre-print at PeerJ while we work out the next step (http://).

The data files in the `data` folder are the files published by Muir et al. at Dryad (http://).

The `analysis.r` file runs R code that loads the data files, re-analyses the data as described in the pre-print, and makes the figure in the `figs` folder.

Required R packages are `lqmm` and `quantreg`.
