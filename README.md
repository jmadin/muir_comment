# Comment on "Limited scope for latitudinal extension of reef corals"

The data and analysis for a comment on Muir et al. (2015) published in Science. The comment was rejected based on Muir et al.'s reponse to it, and so we have posted it as a pre-print at PeerJ while we work out the next step (http://).

The data files in the `data` folder are the files published by Muir et al. at Dryad (http://).

The `analysis.r` file runs R code that loads the data files, re-analyses the data as described in the pre-print, and makes the figure in the `figs` folder.

The R package `lqmm` needs to be installed before the code will run.
